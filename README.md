# Arttribute Core API

This API allows the creation of artwork and definition of its usage terms through "Arttribute licenses." These are licenses similar to Creative Commons licenses that give artists a standardized way to grant permission to use their creative works in generative AI applications, ensuring that only authorized use of artworks is permitted.

API with capabilities for:
- Creating artifacts with unique image hashes.(artifacts represent art items created by artists)
- Creating and managing artifact collections.Â 
- Making attributions and checking Arttributions
